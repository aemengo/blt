===============

Your BOSH director will be accessible at %s. To make sure your requests
target appropriately you may need to add the IP to your network interface, like so:

$ %s

Seeing your BOSH target credentials is as simple as using the "env" command. Thus in your
terminal, you can target like so:

$ %s

Networking
==========

BOSH Lit is provisioned with the network of %s. It also has a minimal cloud-config
pre-configured with the appropriate attributes. Should you wish to deploy Cloud Foundry
on your local instance, you can use this cloud-config here:

https://github.com/aemengo/bosh-runc-cpi-release/blob/master/operations/cf/cloud-config.yml

In order to access ports for new deployments from the host, you must use the "blt expose" command.
Port forwarding is done à la ssh. For more information, you can invoke the following:

$ %s

State
=====

The "state.json" and "creds.yml" of your BOSH director is held at "$HOME/.blt/state/bosh" by default.
For adequate state preservation between VM "ups" and "downs", direct access is NOT recommended.

To override where files are kept, you may use the following environment variable:

$ %s

To see the message again, you can always run the blt CLI tool with no arguments:

$ %s`,
		boldWhite.Sprint("10.0.0.4"),
		boldWhite.Sprint("sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 10.0.0.4"),
		boldWhite.Sprintf(`eval "$(blt env)"`),
		boldWhite.Sprintf("10.0.0.0/16"),
		boldWhite.Sprintf("blt expose -h"),
		boldWhite.Sprintf("export BLT_HOME=/path/to/dir"),
		boldWhite.Sprintf("blt"),
	)
}
